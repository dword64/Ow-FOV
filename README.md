# Overwatch-FOV-Changer

**FOV-Changer** is a simple tool written in modern C++ that can be used to extend your FOV limit from 103 up to 179 and down to 1.

## Why ?

Some players prefer to have a wider field of view in games for a more immersive experience or to gain a competitive advantage. I also cba for the Code(Clean Code etc) **Also its not the safest method so use at your own risk!**

## How to Use ?

1. Download the tool from the release site.
2. Execute the batch file.
3. Start up Overwatch and enjoy the increased FOV!

**Note:** `If you build the project yourself, it is recommended to use the same injector as the one used in the batch file or any injector of your choice.`

## How to Build ?

Simple, **Clone the Repository** and **open the Solution**, *you may need some SDK's as we are using C++ Version 17*.
To actually *Build* the Project all you have to do is select the **Release Configuration** and... well... *build it*.
